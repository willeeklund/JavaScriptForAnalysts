== Why should you care about javascript ? ==

* Anything Web Related
Why should you care about javascript and for whom is this presentation made for ?
Well nowadays Javascript will knock on your door for ANYTHING web related or
even remotely web related that your customers are doing.

* Grow as a developer
Some developers arent used to functional thinking, and after some time with javascript,
I feel that I write more consise and expressive code in my c# projects


== Who is this presentation made for ? ==
When I joined Netlight, I started at the Betsson site team with the thought
 "Hey its Web development. 13 year olds can do it .. How hard can it be ?",
However, soon I discovered that I was not by far the fastest and most successful
 developer in that team, and it was not HTML or CSS that held me back, it was JS.

 Wilhelm here has had the same experience in his professional life and as two typical
Netlighters we started aquiering this knowledge on the side and now one can call
us Javascript ninjas.


Questions like:
    How do you debug JS ?
    What is JQuery ?
    Browser compatibility issues ?
    Why doesn't this code that I just wrote work like Java ?
    JS is a weak typed. What does that really mean?
    Help, I have 1500 lines of unstructured JS, How do I structure it ?
    How do I find information about JS Apis .. ?
    etc etc



This presentation is made for those with no js background and want to skip the
headache and ordeal of aquiring this knowledge.

== Table Of Contents ==
